# Database Connectivity Fix

## Problem
The system was showing "Database Connectivity: FAIL" with the error:
```
Execute returned results, which is not allowed in SQLite.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/src/lib/system-test.ts` line 60, where `$executeRaw` was being used for a SELECT query. In SQLite, `$executeRaw` cannot return results, while `$queryRaw` can.

## Fix Applied
Changed line 60 in `/src/lib/system-test.ts` from:
```typescript
await db.$executeRaw`SELECT 1`
```
to:
```typescript
await db.$queryRaw`SELECT 1 as test`
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/lib/system-test.ts` - Fixed database connectivity test method

## Files Added
- `/scripts/test-fixed-db.js` - Test script to verify the fix
- `/scripts/deploy-fix.sh` - Deployment script to apply the fix

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Database Connection Directly
```bash
node scripts/test-fixed-db.js
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸ§ª Testing fixed database connectivity...
Testing $queryRaw (fixed method)...
âœ… $queryRaw successful: [ { test: 1n } ]
Testing $executeRaw (broken method)...
âœ… $executeRaw correctly failed: Execute returned results, which is not allowed in SQLite.
Testing actual cryptocurrency query...
âœ… Found 4 cryptocurrencies
Testing actual price history query...
âœ… Found 0 price records
ðŸŽ‰ All database tests passed - fix is working!
```

### 2. Deploy the Fix
```bash
# Stop server and clean cache
pkill -f "tsx server.ts"
rm -rf .next/*

# Start server
npm run dev > dev.log 2>&1 &

# Wait for server to start
sleep 10

# Test API endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/system-health
```

### 3. Verify API Response
The API should now return:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T06:33:01.399Z",
  "overall": "HEALTHY" or "DEGRADED",
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "Database Connectivity",
      "status": "PASS",
      "duration": 1,
      "message": "Successfully connected to database"
    }
    // ... other tests
  ]
}
```

## Expected System Health Improvement
Before fix: System health was 75% with Database Connectivity failing
After fix: System health should improve to 85-95% with Database Connectivity passing

## Troubleshooting

### If the fix doesn't work:
1. **Clean build cache**: `rm -rf .next/*`
2. **Restart server**: Stop all node processes and restart with `npm run dev`
3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the fix is present in `src/lib/system-test.ts`
4. **Verify database**: Run `npx prisma db push` to ensure database is in sync

### If API still returns 404:
1. **Check route**: The correct endpoint is `/api/system-health` not `/api/system-test`
2. **Verify server is running**: Check processes with `ps aux | grep tsx`
3. **Check port**: Ensure server is running on port 3000 with `lsof -i :3000`

## Additional Notes
- The fix only affects the database connectivity test method
- All other database operations were already using the correct Prisma methods
- The system should now show improved health scores
- External API issues (like AI analysis) may still show as warnings but don't affect core functionality
